<h1>Data analysis of NBA games using Python</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I am an nba fan. Every goal in the game, steals or reverses the buzzer ball can make you boil. 
In addition to watching the exciting game, I want to try to judge the combat effectiveness of each team 
and predict the outcome of a game by using the previous statistics of the NBA game.</p>

 <h2>NBA game statistics gathering</h2>
  <p>In this lab, we will use the statistics from Basketball Reference.com. In this website, you can see basic statistics of different players, teams, seasons and league games, such as scores, number of fouls, etc., the number of wins and so on. And we will use the data in the 2016-17 NBA Season Summary here.</p>
  <p>In all the tables summarized in 2016-17, we will use the following three data tables:
  <ul>
  <li>Team Per Game Stats</li>
    <li>Opponent Per Game Stats</li>
    <li>Miscellaneous Stats</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
