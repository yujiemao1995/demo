<h1>Data analysis of NBA games using Python<h1>
<h2>Introduction<h2>
<p>I am an nba fan. Every goal in the game, steals or reverses the buzzer ball can make you boil. 
In addition to watching the exciting game, I want to try to judge the combat effectiveness of each team 
and predict the outcome of a game by using the previous statistics of the NBA game.</p>
